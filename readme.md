# Project Title

site (see references in "Built With" section).
The app is able to generate unique tickets for events.

* A form is used to retrieve user's data (name, surname, email address).

* The ticket id consists of a random 16-bytes binary string wrapped in a QR code image.
* User and ticket data are saved automatically in the Datastore.
* Two API GET are given to retrieve the active tickets ids and the list of all tickets generated by a specific user.
